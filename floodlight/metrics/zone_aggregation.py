    """Aggregates a property over threshold-based zones of another property.

    This function bins frames based on the value of ``binning_property`` and
    aggregates values from ``property_to_aggregate`` within each zone. Common use
    cases include calculating distance covered per velocity zone or time spent in
    different intensity zones [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    property_to_aggregate: PlayerProperty or TeamProperty
        Property values to aggregate. For PlayerProperty, shape is (T, N) where T is
        the number of frames and N is the number of players. For TeamProperty, shape
        is (T,) where T is the number of frames.
    binning_property: PlayerProperty or TeamProperty
        Property values used to determine zone membership. Must have the same shape
        as ``property_to_aggregate``.
    zones: list[tuple[Numeric, Numeric]]
        List of (min, max) threshold tuples defining each zone. Zones use half-open
        intervals [min, max) where the minimum is inclusive and maximum is exclusive.
        For example, [(0, 2), (2, 4)] creates two zones: [0, 2) and [2, 4).
    zone_names: list[str], optional
        Names for each zone. If None, zones are named as "*min* to *max*". Must
        have the same length as ``zones`` if provided.
    aggregation: str, optional
        Aggregation function to apply within each zone. Options:

        - "sum": Sum of property values in zone
        - "count": Number of frames with valid data in zone
        - "mean": Average property value in zone
        - "min": Minimum property value in zone
        - "max": Maximum property value in zone

        Default is 'sum'.

    Returns
    -------
    zone_aggregates: pd.DataFrame
        DataFrame with aggregated values. For PlayerProperty inputs, rows correspond
        to players and columns to zones. For TeamProperty inputs, a single-row
        DataFrame is returned. Empty zones (no frames matching) return NaN for
        mean/min/max and 0 for sum/count.

    Notes
    -----
    Valid property combinations:

    - PlayerProperty by PlayerProperty: Both must have shape (T, N) with matching T and
      N
    - TeamProperty by TeamProperty: Both must have shape (T,) with matching T
    - PlayerProperty by TeamProperty: Aggregation property has shape (T, N),
      binning property has shape (T,). The binning values are broadcast across all
      players.

    Invalid combination:

    - TeamProperty by PlayerProperty: Cannot bin a single team value using
      player-specific thresholds.

    Frames where either property has NaN values are excluded from all aggregations.
    The boundary handling uses half-open intervals [min, max) to avoid ambiguity at
    zone boundaries.

    Examples
    --------
    Calculate distance covered in velocity zones for each player:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from floodlight import PlayerProperty
    >>> from floodlight.metrics.zone_aggregation import aggregate_property_by_zones

    >>> # Create sample data: 4 frames, 2 players
    >>> distances = PlayerProperty(
    ...     property=np.array([[10, 5], [10, 5], [10, 5], [10, 5]], dtype=float),
    ...     name="distance"
    ... )
    >>> velocities = PlayerProperty(
    ...     property=np.array([[1, 6], [3, 8], [1, 6], [3, 8]], dtype=float),
    ...     name="velocity"
    ... )
    >>> # Define velocity zones (m/s)
    >>> zones = [(0, 2), (2, 4), (5, 9)]
    >>> zone_names = ["Low", "Medium", "High"]
    >>> result = aggregate_property_by_zones(
    ...     distances, velocities, zones, zone_names, aggregation='sum'
    ... )
    >>> result
       Low  Medium  High
    0  20.0    20.0   0.0
    1   0.0     0.0  20.0

    Calculate time spent (frame count) in metabolic power zones:

    >>> power = PlayerProperty(
    ...     property=np.array([[5, 15], [8, 25], [12, 30], [6, 18]], dtype=float),
    ...     name="power"
    ... )
    >>> zones = [(0, 10), (10, 20), (20, 35)]
    >>> result = aggregate_property_by_zones(
    ...     power, power, zones, aggregation='count'
    ... )
    >>> result
       0 to 10  10 to 20  20 to 35
    0      3.0       1.0       0.0
    1      0.0       2.0       2.0
